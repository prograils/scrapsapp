  ScrapsApp is code scraps collecting tool (aka snippets) with possibility to share them within a team or designated friend. App is created from need - almost everyday we have problems in office with sharing code - with one person (ie. email config) or with whole team (deployment scripts). 
  Of course you can use gist for it. But I want those scraps to be permanent, correctly described / tagged and searchable within an organization (or maybe even beyond it).
